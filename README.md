### Hey  ğŸ‘‹

I'm Trish (she/her), a full-stack engineer in training from Sydney ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º based in London ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 

I have a background in customer support in start-ups and caught an interest in coding from working alongside super clever development teams building amazing products. 

I'm looking to join another of these super clever teams and use my CS knowledge to build customer-focussed products with great user experiences.
