### Hello 🐙

I'm Trish (she/her):

- a full-stack developer in training at [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) 
- from Sydney 🇦🇺 based in London 🇬🇧 

I have a background in customer support in start-ups and caught an interest in coding from working alongside super clever development teams building amazing products. 

I'm looking to join another of these super clever teams and use my CS knowledge to build customer-focused products with great user experiences.

I like making Spotify playlists and crossing things off to-do lists.
